Using proper pseudo-code, describe three or more primitive algorithms used in your day-to-day life.

1) Get Morning News:

  def get_news
    if_near_tv_remote
      turn tv on
      if channel != "CNN"
        change channel to CNN
      end
    else
      turn ipad on
      go to PBS website
    end
  end

2) Drive to Library:

  def drive_to_library
    while car_on == true
      if gas is low
        go to gas station
      else
        take right on California Street
        take right on Castro Street
        take left on Mercy
        park at library
        checkout room at reception
      end
    end
  end

3) Make Tea:

  def make_tea(num_of_people)
    loose_tea_leaves = 1/2 tsp * num_of_people
    cups_of_water = num_of_people + 3/4 cup

    place loose_tea_leaves in teapot

    until water_temp == 180Â°F
      boil water
    end

    rinse loose_tea_leaves with 3/4 cup of boiled_water
    Pour remaining boiled_water over tea leaves
    steep 5 minutes
    pour into tea_cups
  end
